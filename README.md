Installation:
Install Python 3.11.9
Install Git
Install FFMPEG
Install Ollama

Use the start_ollama.bat file in Scripts to start Ollama.
This script will also pull a reccomended Model. Currently do not have a User firendly way to change this. Said model does require ~8 Gigabytes of VRAM
NOTE: The Included model is regarded as an uncensored model. This means it is capable of generating explicit content. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTENT YOU CHOOSE TO GENERATE.


After Starting ollama, use the start_simple.bat in the root directory. this will setup the virtual environment, as well as download any requirements for the project. It will take 5-10 minutes, depending on your system, so be patient and let it work.

WebUI is Hosted on Http://localhost:5000/
